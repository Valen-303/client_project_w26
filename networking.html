        <h2>Building Meaningful Professional Relationships</h2>
        <p>In the information field, building a strong professional network is as essential as mastering technical skills. By engaging with alumni, industry experts, and mentors, you can gain valuable career insights and uncover hidden job opportunities. We encourage students to actively utilize LinkedIn and the various social platforms provided by UMSI to stay connected.</p>
